### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. We learned about cloning nodes, which is when you create a new node similar to an existing one.  Cloning prevents you from having to rewrite all the statements to configure a new one.
2. We learned about rightArrow and leftArrow functions, which allow the user to shift the images from left or right while looking through the gallery.
3. We are able to use JavaScript to specify objects and methods of the browser through the browser object model.
